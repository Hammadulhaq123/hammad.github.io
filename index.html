            <p>
                Hello, World!
                I can't restrict myself when it comes to learning and have an eager to know about latest technologies
                and how they work. <br>
                My eager to learn new technologies drove me simple! <br>
                Forgone in view I started to take interest in Computer Science because it plays an important role in
                every Innovation and everyday you get a chance to learn something new... <br>
                Started my programming journey as a Frontend Web Developer after learning the basic languages involved
                in frontend development but later on realized that frontend is just a planet and I need to discover the
                whole universe, So I started learning backend programming and the process of seeking knowledge
                continues. <br>
                RightNow I implement whatever I learn everyday and work as a freelancer.

                            <span>HTML is essential to learn because it's the foundation of all websites and is used to create the structure and layout of web pages. Without it, creating websites would not be possible. It's also compatible with all web browsers, which means that websites created with HTML can be viewed on any device with a web browser. That's why I prefered knowing everything about HTML.</span>

                            <span>CSS is an essential technology to learn because it's used to control the layout, design, and presentation of web pages. With CSS, you can change the colors, fonts, and spacing of a web page, which can make it more visually appealing and user-friendly. As CSS allows you to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices, It was mandatory to adapt it!</span>

                            <span>I learned Javascript because it's used to create interactive and dynamic web pages. With JavaScript, you can make a web page respond to user input, create animations, and update the content of a web page. It's also used for client-side validation, which improves the user experience and security of web pages.

Also it is a popular language for beginners.

                    I cloned this as I didn't had much skills then so I just learned the topics by watching videos and implemented in the mean time.
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    I consider that designing a webpage that is completely responsive is a bit heck and this website was my first responsive website as well.

                    <br>
                    Working on a chat application is difficult because it involves many core concepts of Javascript appending children divs e.t.c so this project helped me in learning those core concept and those concepts remained fruitful until now.
